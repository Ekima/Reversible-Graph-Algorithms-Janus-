This project contains various small pieces of Janus code.

The code has been created as part of my bachelor's project, titled
Reversible Graph Algorithms, and are made up of two different types of code:

Practice code, used for learning the Janus language.
Reversible graph algorithms and data structures, part of the actual project.

The bachelor's project takes place Fall/Winter 2014.
